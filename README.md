**Author: Yangang Chen. My Machine Learning Library (in particular, my Neural Network Library) in Python. Python version: 3.5.**

**Contents:**

1. **My own implementation** for **feedforward neural networks**.

2. **My own implementation** for **convolutional neural networks**.

3. **My own implementation** for **recurrent neural networks**.

4. Using **scikit-learn** and **pandas** libraries for classification.

5. Using **tensorflow** and **keras** libraries convolutional neural networks.

**Requirements:**

To run the code, you need to install **Python** and the following libraries: **matplotlib, numpy, scipy, PIL, pandas, bs4, sklearn, tensorflow**, etc. I suggest you to use **Anaconda** to manage the libraries.
